/*
the anonymous function has accessed the name variable in the outer scope. Also pay attention to the order in which the messages are printed to the console. The execution doesnâ€™t stop when setTimeout() is called. It continues on and the After setTimeout message is displayed immediately. Two seconds later, the sayHello() function is called and the greeting is displayed.
